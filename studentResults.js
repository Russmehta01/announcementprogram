     CODE TO HANDLE "ALL Checkboxes and Dropdown selections":
  
      if the type of element property or value has all and its true, all checkboxes of that type are 
      skipped in the comparision because its always going to match.
      e.g All grades for student will always match with all grades for teacher.
      e.g grade 9 for student will always match for ALL grades from the teacher
  
      In the same regard, we also want to ensure that if even 1 selected grade between the student and teacher are shared, that the code will return a match.
      e.g suppose the teacher selects grade 9 and 10, but the student selects grade 9 only, the code should still return a match since there is 1 common property. We do this by keeping track of the amount of matches with a counter, and we ovveride the falsy value if the code finds a match.
